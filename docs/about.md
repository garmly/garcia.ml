# About Me

I am a 1st year graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University working under [Prof. Vijay Vedula ](https://cbrlcolumbia.com/). I completed my bachelor's in MechE with a minor in Computer Science here too. I'm interested in a wide range of topics generally revolving around data-driven fluid mechanics modelling.
