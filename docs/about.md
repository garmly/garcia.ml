# About Me

I am an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University working under [Prof. Vijay Vedula](https://cbrlcolumbia.com/). I completed my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science here too. I'm interested in a wide range of topics generally revolving around data-driven fluid mechanics modelling.

While most of my current work is in data-driven fluid mechanics, I have previously dabbled in combustion modelling and stochastic PDEs. Outside of my academic interests, I also build rockets. I previously led Columbia's [robotics club](https://www.columbiarobotics.club/) and [rocketry team](https://columbiaspace.org/missions/rockets/).
