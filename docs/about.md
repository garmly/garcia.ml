# About Me

I am an [NSF Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University working under [Prof. Vijay Vedula](https://cbrlcolumbia.com/). Before entering grad school, I received my bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science here too. I'm interested in a wide range of topics generally revolving around data-driven fluid mechanics modelling.

While most of my current work is in machine learning for CFD, I have previously dabbled in combustion modelling and stochastic PDEs. Outside of my academic interests, I also build rockets and am currently learning how to fly a plane. In undergrad, I led Columbia's [robotics club](https://www.columbiarobotics.club/) and [rocketry team](https://columbiaspace.org/missions/rockets/).

The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:garcia.mlawrence@gmail.com). If you would prefer to see my resume in paper form, click [here](/assets/resume.pdf).
