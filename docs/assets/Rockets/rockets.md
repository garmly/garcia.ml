# Rocketry
I was on the head of Columbia's rocketry team, a part of the [Columbia Space Initiative](https://columbiaspace.org), for all four years of my undergrad. For the first three years, I was responsible for the design, analysis, manufacturing, and testing of all cold fluid systems onboard our Paraffin-Nitrous oxide hybrid rocket. In my senior year, I was responsible for all of the high-level technical decisions as team co-captain. Under my tenure, we were able to launch at the [Friends of Amateur Rocketry](https://friendsofamateurrocketry.org/) launch site in Mojave, CA. Additionally, I was a part of an independent project developing a Kerosene-Nitrous oxide liquid bipropellant rocket called Project Swordfish. In this capacity, I was responsible for all avionics onboard and developing a robust control schema for the rocket. I've attached some highlights of my work on Columbia's rocketry below.
