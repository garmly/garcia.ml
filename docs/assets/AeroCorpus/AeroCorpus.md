# AeroCorpus

This work is intended to build a working knowledge of a wide range of Aerospace Engineering topics from reasonably close to first principles analysis. AeroCorpus attempts this from my perspective as a Mechanical Engineering graduate student and will reflect my own research interests including computational mechanics, continuum mechanics, and dynamical systems. This is an evolving body of work and is always under construction.
